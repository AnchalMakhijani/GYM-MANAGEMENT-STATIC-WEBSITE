	<p><h1><u>Private Women Stdio Only</u></h1>we have a special section reserved and accessed by only women. This woman’s only section is a huge
	asset for us at chunoti gym because it is known that one of the barriers experienced by women includes discomfort or shyness when surrounded 
	by many people working out. The women’s only gym can also be used as a transition into working out in the main gym. As many of our new members
	are first-time gym members, this area is a perfect place to familiarize yourself with what a gym is all about. that this area is only used by 
	women by allowing access only through the women’s locker room. This area is equipped with the most essential machines for a full-body workout
	and also included a variety of cardio equipment and of free weights, kettle balls and mats
