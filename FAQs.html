	<h2> Questions You Might Have</h2>
	<hr align="left"/>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>what are Fitness Assessments?</summary>
		Fitness Assessments initially help your personal trainer measure your personal baseline, and will be completed again every 6 weeks
		so they can update and evolve your program as your fitness level progresses. We believe in regularly tracking metrics unique to 
		your goals that reinforce constant progress (vs. achieving perfection); so we can celebrate with you along the way and help ensure
		that you are continuously improving to live your strongest and healthiest life.
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>how will I feel after my first personal training session?</summary>
		You may feel some soreness after your initial session, or at other points throughout your fitness journey as new movements are 
		introduced into your program. The soreness is caused by a buildup of lactic acid and is completely normal, but you should still
		be able to continue with your daily activities. If you feel anything more than discomfort or tenderness for more than 1-2 days
		after your session, or if you are experiencing pain which may feel more debilitating, that could be an indicator that something 
		is wrong. If you have any concerns, talk to your trainer at the start of your next session so they can adjust your program
		accordingly.
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>how long until I see results?</summary>
		Like most things in life, the more YOU put into it, the more YOU will get out of it. Personal trainers will work with you on
		establishing both short and long-term goals, will put you on a path to help you meet them, and will work with you to adjust 
		or set new goals along the way. To make sure we stay on track, we conduct regular Fitness Assessments (described above in 
		“what are Fitness Assessments”). Clients who have followed their complete weekly plan typically see positive results, including
		remarkable improvements in strength, mobility, flexibility and endurance during this period.
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>how many times a week does the typical client work out?</summary>
		There are no “typical” clients – everyone’s program is unique to their goals, their time commitment, and their budget.
		Some clients train 2-4 times per week. We offer in-studio and live virtual training options for your training so that 
		it’s easy to meet whenever and wherever.
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>how do I schedule my personal training sessions?</summary>
		To support your success, we recommend that you work with us to set a recurring schedule of consistent days and times of training.
		This way you don’t have to schedule each individual session - consistency will help you develop the habit. If you have an erratic 
		schedule, a conflict with a scheduled session, or if you wish to change your recurring schedule, just contact your studio with 
		ample notice to discuss your options
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>what time should I arrive for my scheduled session?</summary>
		You should arrive at your session 10-15 minutes early so that you can do a short warm-up on the cardio equipment or stretch before
		your session begins. Warming up your body ahead of time ensures that you get the most from your training session.
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>what do I need to bring to my session?</summary>
		A positive attitude! Water, a towel, equipment, and motivation will be provided for you by your personal trainer - just
		show up ready to take one more step toward achieving your goals.

	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>if I have an injury, am taking medication or am pregnant, can I still work out?</summary>
		In most cases, if you have a short term circumstance that you are seeing a doctor for, you'll want to confirm with your doctor 
		that it's safe to begin a personal training program. Once your doctor gives the thumbs up, your program can be designed to 
		accommodate your needs. in chunoti gym personal trainers are highly qualified, professional trainers who can help you reduce
		pain, increase mobility, improve your overall health, and will keep you safe while doing it! They can even work directly with
		your doctor or physical therapist to ensure your program is safe and effective. Check out our “Improving Health” category of our
		Success Stories page to read relatable stories!
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>can I share my personal training sessions?</summary>
		A package of one-on-one sessions may be shared with a family member. This must be established and set up at the time of purchase.
		A package of partner training sessions may not be shared. Please reach out to your local studio for more information.
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>how do I refer a friend to Chunoti gym?</summary>
		We would love the opportunity to have friends or family join us as a Chunoti client. If you provide us with 
		their contact information, we will get in touch with your referral and schedule a complimentary Signature Fit Evaluation.
		If your referral purchases a package, you will receive a special offer. Please contact your studio for details of the 
		referral program.
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>why does Chunoti do team training?</summary>
		Our team based approach allows clients to benefit from the array of expertise on the trainer team, to ensure you learn
		something new in every session. Every trainer on the team is highly qualified and your customized program, progress and
		notes are shared across the trainer team so you will always pick up exactly where you left off. This also ensures you 
		can work out when it’s most convenient for you, not just when your trainer is available.
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>can I request a specific trainer for my personal training session?</summary>
		We may not be able to guarantee a specific trainer, but please know that if you have any concerns regarding a member 
		of the trainer team, you can contact the studio directly.
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>can I come in and use the studio if I am not scheduled for a personal training session?</summary>
		Please contact your local coach to learn about studio use outside of training sessions.
	</details>
	<details class="detailfont">
		<summary>what can I do outside the studio to achieve my goals?</summary>
		Everyone has different goals so there is not one answer to this question. We encourage you to keep a food log/journal if
		you are interested in weight loss. As part of your session time, someone on the team can review your log and provide
		recommendations.

		If flexibility and mobility are a primary focus for you, we encourage foam rolling and stretching on your own. As part 
		of your session, your trainer will be happy to discuss this with you.

		For most clients, we suggest doing some form of cardiovascular exercise on your own, outside your chunoti 
		sessions. Your trainer can provide you with more specific recommendations that are best suited to your goals and 
		program. 

		Talk to your trainer if you have specific questions related to your goals.
